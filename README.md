## Project Overview

## Part 1: Masses and springs

### Screenshots

Below are some screenshots rendered from pinned2.json file which clearly shows the structure of point masses and springs. We can cearly see the different types of springs (structural and bending constrains are totally overlapped. ) and point masses.

### Comparison Between different Constraintes

According to the definition of the three types of the constraints, we can see that the normal one (with all three constraints) have both the diagonal springs and the one which is parallel to the x or y axis. However, we can only see the diagonal springs with the shearing constraints only. And we can see the diagonal springs are moved without shearing constraints. The two left constraints (structural, bending) both depict related springs between point masses that locate nearby or 2 distance away from each other along axis.
